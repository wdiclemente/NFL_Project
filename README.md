Messing around with NFL statistics

### Raw data
Data in directory `raw_data` comes from Todd Steussie's database `NFL Play Statistics dataset (2004 to present)` available at:

This version was retrieved on July 20th, 2019 and dumped into .csv files.

It is uploaded here due to a form submission that will not accept the Kaggle link...

### The goal
The intent of this project is to try to answer the question "Does the quarterback make the receiver, or does the reciever make the quarterback?"

I devise a metric for evaluating a receiver's season as well as the season of the players who threw to him.  Ideally, the metric score should equate QB and WR seasons of similar quality, so it can be easily seen if a WR "outplays" his QB.

The metric is very much still a work in progress, but it's been fun to work on so far :)
