This plot shows the receiving yards for former Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne (black solid points).  
His season totals from 2004-2014 are compared to the league average (blue dashed line) as well as the spread between the league's minimum and maximum totals among all receivers with at least 50 catches in that season.  

From this plot it can be seen that Wayne's receiving yards were consistently above the league average until the end of his career (he suffered an injury in 2013 and only played in seven out of 16 games that year).  
The drop in performance in 2011 can be tied to an injury at the quarterback position which will be discussed further below in the next plot.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{2504747_pass_total_yards.pdf}
This plot shows the total passing yards for all quarterbacks who threw at least one pass to Reggie Wayne (black solid points). 
Combined season totals for Wayne's quarterbacks from 2004-2014 are compared to the league average for individual quarterbacks (blue dashed line) as well as the spread between the league's minimum and maximum totals for players with 200 pass attempts that season.  
In the event that he caught passes from more than one quarterback in a season (due to injury, for example), all the quarterbacks' stats are aggregated and plotted here.
This can occasionally result in instances where a data point falls above the league maximum (such as in 2014), since when Wayne's quarterbacks are combined, they threw for more yards than the individual league leader.

It is clear that from 2004-2010, Wayne played with a quarterback who was consistently far above the league average (Peyton Manning).
In 2011, Manning missed the entire season due to injury, and the Colts suffered from one of the league's worst passing offenses---responsible for the dip in performance that year---before Andrew Luck took over the following year.
The intent of this project is to disentangle the performance of a receiver from his quarterback.
