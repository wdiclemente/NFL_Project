    "# NFL Project\n",
    "This is a (currently incomplete) hobby project for messing around with NFL statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original intent for this project was to find a way to separate the performance of a wide receiver (WR) from his quarterback (QB) in order to settle frequent debates with firends.  Since the two positions are so closely linked, it can be difficult to determine how good a WR is relative to his peers if he plays with an elite QB, and vice versa.  In order to answer this question, I create a metric to evaluate a WR's and QB's performance relative to the rest of the NFL."
